# MusicalPowershell

This was a quick project to take my first steps into learning Powershell.

I was inspired by this Gist [beep_mario_victory_theme.ps1](https://gist.github.com/ataylor32/24f429e147d8b2a758d7) to try and make a more repeatable script.

I used a [Space Station 13 Wiki](https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Songs) for music sheets as a reference, since it hosts simple songs that can be played in-game. Because of this, only songs that match this format will work.

I used a table from MTU for the note to frequency matching:
- https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html
- https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/PofMCopyRight.html

# Run the Script

To run the script, simply run the script file with no parameters passed in.

A `song.txt` file must be present with a matching format to the file included in this repo.

The included song is [FÃ¼r Elise](https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Songs/Classical#Beethoven.2C_Ludwig_van:_F.C3.BCr_Elise)
